.SH NAME
gfarm2fs \- mount a Gfarm file system

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgfarm2fs\fR \fBmount_point\fR [ \fBoptions\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
gfarm2fs mounts the Gfarm file system at the specified mount point.

.SH "GENERAL OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-h\fR
display a list of command options.
.TP
\fB-V\fR
display version.
.TP
\fB-o \fIopt,[opt...]\fB\fR
specify mount options.

.SH "GFARM2FS OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-o syslog=\fIfacility\fB\fR
specify syslog facility.  default is local0.
.TP
\fB-o loglevel=\fIpriority\fB\fR
specify syslog priority level.  default is notice.
.TP
\fB-E \fIT\fB\fR
specify the timeout of attribute cache.  default is 1.0 seconds.
.TP
\fB-o gfs_stat_timeout=\fIT\fB\fR
same as \-E option
.TP
\fB-o ncopy=\fIN\fB\fR
specify the number of copies automatically created
when a file is created.  default is 0, which means
disabling automatic replication mechanism.
.TP
\fB-o copy_limit=\fIN\fB\fR
specify the maximum number of concurrent copy
creations.  this is effective if automatic replication
is enabled.  default is 0.
.TP
\fB-o disable_genuine_nlink\fR
uses faked st_nlink (32000) of struct stat for directories.
.TP
\fB-o directory_quota_rename_error_exdev\fR
enables client-side directory move between directories which belong to
different directory quota.
CAUTION: such client-side move will be really slow, because all files under
the directory will be copied from source filesystem nodes to the client,
and be copied back to destination filesystem nodes, and because
this operation is essentially same with copy and remove,
file owner settings may not be preserved, and it's possible that
some directories cannot be correctly moved due to permission problems.
.TP
\fB-o auto_uid_min=\fIN\fB\fR
specify the minimum UID automatically assigned.
.TP
\fB-o auto_uid_max=\fIN\fB\fR
specify the maximum UID automatically assigned.
.TP
\fB-o auto_gid_min=\fIN\fB\fR
specify the minimum GID automatically assigned.
.TP
\fB-o auto_gid_max=\fIN\fB\fR
specify the maximum GID automatically assigned.

.SH "FUSE OPTIONS"
.PP
see \fBgfarm2fs \-h\fR

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE"
.TP
\fBGFARM_CONFIG_FILE\fR
specifies the Gfarm configuration file.

.SH "NOTES"
.PP
When there is not the same local account name as the Gfarm global user
name, a temporal UID is assigned between auto_uid_min and
auto_uid_max.  When there is not the same local group name as the
Gfarm global group name, a temporal GID is assigned between
auto_gid_min and auto_gid_max.

When a temporal UID/GID cannot be assigned, setfacl(1) fails with
\fBEPERM\fR.

.SH "SECURITY NOTES"
.PP
When untrusted users are registered in the \fBgfarmroot\fR group or
\fBgfarm_root.{user,group}\fR extended attributes of any files or
directories, a Security Hole exists on the mount point of gfarm2fs
with "\fB-o suid,allow_other\fR" option executed by root (even if
either "\fB-o ro\fR" option or "\fB-o default_permissions\fR" option
is also specified).  Therefore both "\fB-o suid,allow_other\fR" option
and \fBgfarm_root.{user,group}\fR extended attributes should not be
used.
